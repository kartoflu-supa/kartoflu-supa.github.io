                        She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
                        In the shape of an "L" on her forehead
                        Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
                        Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
                        Didn't make sense not to live for fun
                        Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
                        So much to do, so much to see
                        So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
                        You'll never know if you don't go
                        You'll never shine if you don't glow

                        And all that glitters is gold
                        Only shooting stars break the mold
                        It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
                        You're bundled up now, wait till you get older
                        But the meteor men beg to differ
                        Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
                        The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
                        The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
                        My world's on fire, how about yours?
                        That's the way I like it and I never get bored

                        I need to get myself away from this place
                        I said yep what a concept
                        I could use a little fuel myself

                                I thought love was only true in fairy tales
                                Meant for someone else but not for me
                                Love was out to get me

                                I thought love was more or less a giving thing
                                The more I gave the less I got oh yeah
